# Project Euler in Julia
I recently found out about [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) where you are given are mathematical problem which can be solved using programming. To learn a little more about the Julia programming language, I tried to solve some problems using it. Here I will upload the solutions that I have verified with the solutions from [nayuki](https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions/blob/master/Answers.txt). I cannot promise that my programs are the most efficient or even efficient for that matter, but if it results in printing out the correct result, then I'm happy.

My programs are written in a Jupyter Notebook file using the Julia programming language.
